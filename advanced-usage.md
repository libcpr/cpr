## Response Objects

`Response` objects are bags of data. Their sole purpose is to give the client information at the end of a request -- there's nothing in the API that uses a `Response` after it gets back to you. This reasoning drove the decision to make the member fields of the response public and mutable.

A `Response` has these fields:

```c++
long status_code; // The HTTP status code for the request
std::string text; // The body of the HTTP response
Header header;    // A map-like collection of the header fields
Url url;          // The effective URL of the ultimate request
double elapsed;   // The total time of the request in seconds
Cookies cookies;  // A map-like collection of cookies returned in the request
```

and they're dead simple to access:

```c++
cpr::Response r = cpr::Get(cpr::Url{"http://www.httpbin.org/get"});
if (r.status_code >= 400) {
    std::cerr << "Error [" << r.status_code << "] making request" << std::endl;
} else {
    std::cout << "Request took " << r.elapsed << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Body:" << std::endl << r.text;
}
```

The `Header` is essentially a map with an important modification. Its keys are case insensitive as required by [RFC 7230](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2):

```c++
cpr::Response r = cpr::Get(cpr::Url{"http://www.httpbin.org/get"});
std::cout << r.header["content-type"] << std::endl;
std::cout << r.header["Content-Type"] << std::endl;
std::cout << r.header["CoNtEnT-tYpE"] << std::endl;
```

All of these should print the same value, `"application/json"`. Cookies similarly are accessed through a map-like interface, but they're not case insensitive:

```c++
cpr::Response r = cpr::Get(cpr::Url{"http://www.httpbin.org/cookies/set?cookies=yummy"});
std::cout << r.cookies["cookies"] << std::endl; // Prints yummy
std::cout << r.cookies["Cookies"] << std::endl; // Prints nothing
```

As you can see, the `Response` object is completely transparent. All of its data fields are accessible at all times, and since its only useful to you insofar as it has information to communicate, you can let it fall out of scope safely when you're done with it.

## Request Headers

Speaking of the `Header`, you can set custom headers in the request call. The object is exactly the same:

{% raw %}
```c++
cpr::Response r = cpr::Get(cpr::Url{"http://www.httpbin.org/headers"},
                  cpr::Header{{"accept", "application/json"}});
std::cout << r.text << std::endl;

/*
 * "headers": {
 *   "Accept": "application/json",
 *   "Host": "www.httpbin.org",
 *   "User-Agent": "curl/7.42.0-DEV"
 * }
 */
```
{% endraw %}

You've probably noticed a similarity between `Header`, `Parameters`, `Payload`, and `Multipart`. They all have constructors of the form:

{% raw %}
```c++
cpr::Header header = cpr::Header{{"header-key", "header-value"}};
cpr::Parameters parameters = cpr::Parameters{{"parameter-key", "parameter-value"}};
cpr::Payload payload = cpr::Payload{{"payload-key", "payload-value"}};
cpr::Multipart multipart = cpr::Multipart{{"multipart-key", "multipart-value"}};
```
{% endraw %}

This isn't an accident -- all of these are map-like objects and their syntax is identical because their semantics depends entirely on the object type. Additionally, it's practical to have `Parameters`, `Payload`, and `Multipart` be swappable because APIs sometimes don't strictly differentiate between them.

## Session Objects

Under the hood, all calls to the primary API modify an object called a `Session` before performing the request. This is the only truly stateful piece of the library, and for most applications it isn't necessary to act on a `Session` directly, preferring to let the library handle it for you.

However, in cases where it is useful to hold on to state, you can use a `Session`:

{% raw %}
```c++
cpr::Url url = cpr::Url{"http://www.httpbin.org/get"};
cpr::Parameters parameters = cpr::Parameters{{"hello", "world"}};
cpr::Session session;
session.SetUrl(url);
session.SetParameters(parameters);

cpr::Response r = session.Get();             // Equivalent to cpr::Get(url, parameters);
std::cout << r.url << std::endl     // Prints http://www.httpbin.org/get?hello=world

cpr::Parameters new_parameters = cpr::Parameters{{"key", "value"}};
session.SetParameters(new_parameters);

cpr::Response new_r = session.Get();         // Equivalent to cpr::Get(url, new_parameters);
std::cout << new_r.url << std::endl // Prints http://www.httpbin.org/get?key=value
```
{% endraw %}

`Session` actually exposes two different interfaces for setting the same option. If you wanted you can do this instead of the above:

{% raw %}
```c++
cpr::Url url = cpr::Url{"http://www.httpbin.org/get"};
cpr::Parameters parameters = cpr::Parameters{{"hello", "world"}};
cpr::Session session;
session.SetOption(url);
session.SetOption(parameters);
cpr::Response r = session.Get();
```
{% endraw %}

This is important so it bears emphasizing: *for each configuration option (like `Url`, `Parameters`), there's a corresponding method `Set<ObjectName>` and a `SetOption(<Object>)`*. The second interface is to facilitate the template metaprogramming magic that lets the API expose order-less methods.

The key to all of this is actually the way [libcurl](http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/) is designed. It uses a somewhat [policy-based design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy-based_design) that relies configuring a single library object (the `curl` handle). Each option configured into that object changes its behavior in mostly orthogonal ways.

`Session` leverages that and exposes a more modern interface that's free of the macro-heavy hulkiness of libcurl. Understanding the policy-based design of libcurl is important for understanding the way the `Session` object behaves.

## Asynchronous Requests

Making an asynchronous request uses a similar but separate interface:

```c++
AsyncResponse fr = cpr::GetAsync(cpr::Url{"http://www.httpbin.org/get"});
// Sometime later
cpr::Response r = fr.get(); // This blocks until the request is complete
std::cout << r.text << std::endl;
```

The call is otherwise identical except instead of `Get`, it's `GetAsync`. Similarly for POST requests, you would call `PostAsync`. The return value of an asynchronous call is actually a `std::future<Response>`:

```c++
AsyncResponse fr = cpr::GetAsync(cpr::Url{"http://www.httpbin.org/get"});
fr.wait() // This waits until the request is complete
cpr::Response r = fr.get(); // Since the request is complete, this returns immediately
std::cout << r.text << std::endl;
```

You can even put a bunch of requests into a `std` container and get them all later:

{% raw %}
```c++
std::vector<std::future<cpr::Response>> container{};
cpr::Url url = cpr::Url{"http://www.httpbin.org/get"};
for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
    container.emplace_back(cpr::GetAsync(url, cpr::Parameters{{"i", std::to_string(i)}}));
}
// Sometime later
for (std::future<cpr::Response>& fr: container) {
    cpr::Response r = fr.get();
    std::cout << r.text << std::endl;
}
```
{% endraw %}

An important note to make here is that arguments passed to an asynchronous call are copied. Under the hood, an asychronous call through the library's API is done with `std::async`. By default, for memory safety, all arguments are copied (or moved if temporary) because there's no syntax level guarantee that the arguments will live beyond the scope of the request.

It's possible to force `std::async` out of this default so that the arguments are passed by reference as opposed to value. Currently, however, `cpr::<method>Async` has no support for forced pass by reference, though this is planned for a future release.

## Asynchronous Callbacks

C++ Requests also supports a callback interface for asynchronous requests. Using the callback interface, you pass in a functor (lambda, function pointer, etc.) as the first argument, and then pass in the rest of the options you normally would in a blocking request. The functor needs to have a single parameter, a `Response` object -- this response is populated when the request completes and the function body executes.

Here's a simple example:

```c++
auto future_text = cpr::GetCallback([](cpr::Response r) {
        return r.text;
    }, cpr::Url{"http://www.httpbin.org/get"});
// Sometime later
if (future_text.wait_for(std::chrono::seconds(0)) == std::future_status::ready) {
    std::cout << future_text.get() << std::endl;
}
```

There are a couple of key features to point out here:

1. The return value is a `std::string`. This isn't hardcoded -- the callback is free to return any value it pleases! When it's time to get that value, a check for if the request is complete is made, and a simple `.get()` call on the future grabs the correct value. This flexibility makes the callback interface delightfully simple, generic, and effective!
2. The lambda capture is empty, but absolutely doesn't need to be. Anything that can be captured inside a lambda normally can be captured in a lambda passed into the callback interface. This additional vector of flexibility makes it highly preferable to use lambdas, though any functor with a `Response` parameter will compile and work.

Additionally, you can enforce immutability of the `Response` simply with a `const Response&` parameter instead of `Response`.

## Setting a Timeout

It's possible to set a timeout for your request if you have strict timing requirements:

```c++
#include <assert.h>

cpr::Response r = cpr::Get(cpr::Url{"http://www.httpbin.org/get"},
                  cpr::Timeout{1000}); // Let's hope we aren't using Time Warner Cable
assert(r.elapsed <= 1); // Less than one second should have elapsed
```

Setting the `Timeout` option sets the maximum allowed time the transfer operation can take. Since C++ Requests is built on top of libcurl, it's important to know what setting this `Timeout` does to the request. You can find more information about the specific libcurl option [here](http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_TIMEOUT_MS.html).

## Setting Callbacks

You can optionally set callbacks for a request. Currently there is support for read, header, write, progress, and debug callbacks.

### ReadCallback

This callback function will be called every time `libcurl` is ready for data to be sent to the server, and provides for streaming uploads.

The callback signature looks like this.

```c++
  bool readCallback(char* buffer, size_t & length);
```

Provide the callback with the ReadCallback options object.  Only one read callback may be set.
When called, `length` is the length of `buffer`.  `buffer` should be filled with data, and `length` updated to how much was filled.
Return `true` on success, or `false` to **cancel** the transfer.

### HeaderCallback

This callback function gets called by `libcurl` once for each non-data line received from the server.
This includes empty lines and the `HTTP` status line.  `\r\n` endings are preserved.

The callback signature looks like this.

```c++
  bool headerCallback(std::string data);
```

Provide the callback with the HeaderCallback options object.  Only one header callback may be set.
When a header callback is set, the Response object's `header` member will not be filled.
Return `true` on success, or `false` to **cancel** the transfer.

### WriteCallback

This callback function gets called by `libcurl` as soon as there is data received that needs to be saved, and provides for streaming downloads.
You could buffer data in your own way, or write every chunk immediately out to some other stream or file.

The callback signature looks like this.

```c++
  bool writeCallback(std::string data);
```

Provide the callback with the WriteCallback options object.  Only one write callback may be set.
When a write callback is set, the Response object's `text` member will not be filled.
Return `true` on success, or `false` to **cancel** the transfer.

### ProgressCallback

While data is being transferred it will be called very frequently, and during slow periods like when nothing is being transferred it can slow down to about one call per second. The callback gets told how much data `libcurl` will transfer and has transferred, in number of bytes.

The callback signature looks like this.

```c++
  bool progressCallback(size_t downloadTotal, size_t downloadNow, size_t uploadTotal, size_t uploadNow);
```

The values are in bytes.  Return `true` to continue the transfer, and `false` to **cancel** it.

Here is an example of using the callback.

```c++
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    cpr::Response r = cpr::Get(cpr::Url{"http://www.httpbin.org/get"},
                      cpr::ProgressCallback([&](size_t downloadTotal, size_t downloadNow, size_t uploadTotal, size_t uploadNow) -> bool
    {
        std::cout << "Downloaded " << downloadNow << " / " << downloadTotal << " bytes." << std::endl;
        return True;
    }));
    return 0;
}
```

### DebugCallback

This is called by `libcurl` for verbose debugging information, including all data transferred.

The callback signature looks like this.

```c++
  enum class DebugCallback::InfoType {
    TEXT = 0,
    HEADER_IN = 1,
    HEADER_OUT = 2,
    DATA_IN = 3,
    DATA_OUT = 4,
    SSL_DATA_IN = 5,
    SSL_DATA_OUT = 6,
  };
  void debugCallback(DebugCallback::InfoType type, std::string data);
```

`type` represents the type of the content, whereas `data` contains the content itself.  Debug messages have type `TEXT`.


## Using Proxies

`Proxies`, like `Parameters`, are map-like objects. It's easy to set one:

{% raw %}
```c++
cpr::Response r = cpr::Get(cpr::Url{"http://www.httpbin.org/get"},
                  cpr::Proxies{{"http", "http://www.fakeproxy.com"}});
std::cout << r.url << std::endl; // Prints http://www.httpbin.org/get, not the proxy url
```
{% endraw %}

It doesn't look immediately useful to have `Proxies` behave like a map, but when used with a `Session` it's more obvious:

{% raw %}
```c++
cpr::Session session;
session.SetProxies({{"http", "http://www.fakeproxy.com"},
                    {"https", "http://www.anotherproxy.com"}})
session.SetUrl("http://www.httpbin.org/get");
{
    cpr::Response r = session.Get();
    std::cout << r.url << std::endl; // Prints http://www.httpbin.org/get after going
                                     // through http://www.fakeproxy.com
}
session.SetUrl("https://www.httpbin.org/get");
{
    cpr::Response r = session.Get();
    std::cout << r.url << std::endl; // Prints https://www.httpbin.org/get after going
                                     // through http://www.anotherproxy.com
}
```
{% endraw %}

Setting `Proxies` on a `Session` lets you intelligently route requests using different protocols through different proxies without having to respecify anything but the request `Url`.

## Sending Cookies

Earlier you saw how to grab a cookie from the request:

```c++
cpr::Response r = cpr::Get(cpr::Url{"http://www.httpbin.org/cookies/set?cookies=yummy"});
std::cout << r.cookies["cookies"] << std::endl; // Prints yummy
std::cout << r.cookies["Cookies"] << std::endl; // Prints nothing
```

You can send back cookies using the same object:

```c++
cpr::Response r = cpr::Get(cpr::Url{"http://www.httpbin.org/cookies/set?cookies=yummy"});
cpr::Response another_r = cpr::Get(cpr::Url{"http://www.httpbin.org/cookies"}, r.cookies);
std::cout << another_r.text << std::endl;

/*
 * {
 *   "cookies": {
 *     "cookie": "yummy"
 *   }
 * }
 */
```

 This is especially useful because `Cookies` often go from server to client and back to the server. Setting new `Cookies` should not look surprising at all:

{% raw %}
```c++
cpr::Response r = cpr::Get(cpr::Url{"http://www.httpbin.org/cookies"},
                  cpr::Cookies{{"ice cream", "is delicious"}});
std::cout << r.text << std::endl;

/*
 * {
 *   "cookies": {
 *     "ice%20cream": "is%20delicious"
 *   }
 * }
 */
```
{% endraw %}

By default `Cookies` and their values will be URL-encoded.
Although this is recommend, it is not mandatory for `Cookies` to be URL-encoded.
{% raw %}
```
[...]
To maximize compatibility with user agents, servers that wish to
store arbitrary data in a cookie-value SHOULD encode that data, for
example, using Base64 [RFC4648].
[...]
```
{% endraw %}
Source: [RFC6265](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6265.txt)

URL-encoding for `Cookies` can be disabled by setting `encode = false` in the `Cookie` constructor.
{% raw %}
```c++
cpr::Response r = cpr::Get(cpr::Url{"http://www.httpbin.org/cookies"},
                  cpr::Cookies{{"ice cream", "is delicious"}}, false);
std::cout << r.text << std::endl;

/*
 * {
 *   "cookies": {
 *     "ice cream": "is delicious"
 *   }
 * }
 */
```
{% endraw %}

## PUT and PATCH Requests

PUT and PATCH requests work identically to POST requests, with the only modification being that the specified HTTP method is `"PUT"` or `"PATCH"` instead of `"POST"`. Use this when the semantics of the API you're calling implements special behavior for these requests:

{% raw %}
```c++
#include <assert.h>

// We can't POST to the "/put" endpoint so the status code is rightly 405
assert(cpr::Post(cpr::Url{"http://www.httpbin.org/put"},
                 cpr::Payload{{"key", "value"}}).status_code == 405);

// On the other hand, this works just fine
cpr::Response r = cpr::Put(cpr::Url{"http://www.httpbin.org/put"},
                  cpr::Payload{{"key", "value"}});
std::cout << r.text << std::endl;

/*
 * {
 *   "args": {},
 *   "data": "",
 *   "files": {},
 *   "form": {
 *     "key": "value"
 *   },
 *   "headers": {
 *     ..
 *     "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
 *     ..
 *   },
 *   "json": null,
 *   "url": "https://httpbin.org/put"
 * }
 */
```
{% endraw %}

Most often, PUTs are used to update an existing object with a new object. Of course, there's no guarantee that any particular API uses PUT semantics this way, so use it only when it makes sense to. Here's a sample PATCH request, it's essentially identical:

{% raw %}
```c++
#include <assert.h>

// We can't POST or PUT to the "/patch" endpoint so the status code is rightly 405
assert(cpr::Post(cpr::Url{"http://www.httpbin.org/patch"},
                 cpr::Payload{{"key", "value"}}).status_code == 405);
assert(cpr::Put(cpr::Url{"http://www.httpbin.org/patch"},
                cpr::Payload{{"key", "value"}}).status_code == 405);

// On the other hand, this works just fine
cpr::Response r = cpr::Patch(cpr::Url{"http://www.httpbin.org/patch"},
                    cpr::Payload{{"key", "value"}});
std::cout << r.text << std::endl;

/*
 * {
 *   "args": {},
 *   "data": "",
 *   "files": {},
 *   "form": {
 *     "key": "value"
 *   },
 *   "headers": {
 *     ..
 *     "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
 *     ..
 *   },
 *   "json": null,
 *   "url": "https://httpbin.org/patch"
 * }
 */
```
{% endraw %}

As with PUT, PATCH only works if the method is supported by the API you're sending the request to.

## Other Request Methods

C++ Requests also supports `DELETE`, `HEAD`, and `OPTIONS` methods in the expected forms:

```c++
// Regular, blocking modes
cpr::Response delete_response = cpr::Delete(cpr::Url{"http://www.httpbin.org/delete"});
cpr::Response head_response = cpr::Head(cpr::Url{"http://www.httpbin.org/get"});
cpr::Response options_response = cpr::OPTIONS(cpr::Url{"http://www.httpbin.org/get"});

// Asynchronous, future mode
AsyncResponse async_delete_response = cpr::DeleteAsync(cpr::Url{"http://www.httpbin.org/delete"});
AsyncResponse async_head_response = cpr::HeadAsync(cpr::Url{"http://www.httpbin.org/get"});
AsyncResponse async_options_response = cpr::OptionsAsync(cpr::Url{"http://www.httpbin.org/get"});

// Asynchronous, callback mode
auto cb_delete_response = cpr::DeleteCallback([](cpr::Response r) {
        return r.text;
    }, cpr::Url{"http://www.httpbin.org/delete"});
auto cb_head_response = cpr::HeadCallback([](cpr::Response r) {
        return r.status_code;
    }, cpr::Url{"http://www.httpbin.org/get"});
auto cb_options_response = cpr::OptionsCallback([](cpr::Response r) {
        return r.status_code;
    }, cpr::Url{"http://www.httpbin.org/get"});
```

Currently, `"PATCH"` is not an implemented HTTP method. It soon will be, and its mechanics will be identically to the example above. Stay tuned!

## HTTPS Options

CPR verifies SSL certificates for HTTPS requests, just like a web browser. By default, SSL verification is enabled.

```c++
cpr::Response r = cpr::Get(cpr::Url{"https://www.httpbin.org/get"});
```

The underlying implementation automatically switches to SSL/TLS if `libcurl` provides the appropriate support.

You can also further customize the behavior of the SSL/TLS protocol by passing more configuration items to the request.

### SSL/TLS Version

The SSL/TLS protocol has evolved in many different versions for security and performance reasons.

Starting with version 7.39, `libcurl` uses TLS v1.0 by default.

If you have security and performance concerns, you can force a newer version of the protocol.

```c++
cpr::Ssl sslOpts = cpr::Ssl(ssl:TLSv1_2{});
cpr::Response r = cpr::Get(cpr::Url{"https://www.httpbin.org/get"}, sslOpts);
```

Or a lower but insecure version of the protocol for compatibility reasons.

* `TLSv1`: TLS v1.0 or later 
* `SSLv2`: SSL v2 (but not SSLv3)
* `SSLv3`: SSL v3 (but not SSLv2)
* `TLSv1_0`: TLS v1.0 or later (libcurl 7.34.0)
* `TLSv1_1`: TLS v1.1 or later (libcurl 7.34.0)
* `TLSv1_2`: TLS v1.2 or later (libcurl 7.34.0)
* `TLSv1_3`: TLS v1.3 or later (libcurl 7.52.0)
* `MaxTLSVersion`: maximum supported TLS version, or the default value from the SSL library is used. (libcurl 7.54.0)
* `MaxTLSv1_0`: maximum supported TLS version as TLS v1.0. (libcurl 7.54.0)
* `MaxTLSv1_1`: maximum supported TLS version as TLS v1.1. (libcurl 7.54.0)
* `MaxTLSv1_2`: maximum supported TLS version as TLS v1.2. (libcurl 7.54.0)
* `MaxTLSv1_3`: maximum supported TLS version as TLS v1.3. (libcurl 7.54.0)

### ALPN and NPN

Some older HTTPS services do not support ALPN and NPN negotiation, which may result in connections not being established properly. Compatibility issues can be resolved by disabling ALPN/NPN support for the request.

```c++
cpr::Ssl sslOpts = cpr::Ssl(ssl::ALPN{false}, ssl::NPN{false});
cpr::Response r = cpr::Get(cpr::Url{"https://www.httpbin.org/get"}, sslOpts);
```

* `ALPN`: [ALPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-Layer_Protocol_Negotiation) in the SSL handshake. (libcurl 7.36.0)

> Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) is a Transport Layer Security (TLS) extension that allows the application layer to negotiate which protocol should be performed over a secure connection in a manner that avoids additional round trips and which is independent of the application-layer protocols. It is needed by secure HTTP/2 connections, which improves the compression of web pages and reduces their latency compared to HTTP/1.x. The ALPN and HTTP/2 standards emerged from development work done by Google on the now withdrawn SPDY protocol.

* `NPN`: [NPN](https://www.imperialviolet.org/2013/03/20/alpn.html) in the SSL handshake. (libcurl 7.36.0)

> NPN, or Next Protocol Negotiation, allows a TLS connection to negotiate which application-level protocol will be running across it.

### Verify SSL/TLS Certificate and Status

By default, the Libcurl library attempts to verify the SSL/TLS protocol server-side certificate and its status.

If you wish to connect to a server that uses a self-signed certificate, you can turn off the corresponding check with the `VerifyHost`, `VerifyPeer` and `VerifyStatus` options.

* `VerifyHost`: the server cert is for the server it is known as.
* `VerifyPeer`: the authenticity of the peer's certificate.
* `VerifyStatus`: the status of the server cert using the "Certificate Status Request" TLS extension (aka. OCSP stapling). (libcurl 7.41.0)

### SSL Client Certificate

Some HTTPS services require client certificates to be given at the time of connection for authentication and authentication.

You can specify filenames for client certificates and private keys using the `CertFile` and `KeyFile` options.

```c++
cpr::Ssl sslOpts = cpr::Ssl(ssl::CertFile{"cert.pem"}, ssl::KeyFile{"key.pem"});
cpr::Response r = cpr::Get(cpr::Url{"https://www.httpbin.org/get"}, sslOpts);
```

The default certificate and private key files are in PEM format, and DER format files can also be imported via `DerCert` and `DerKey` if desired.

### Certificate Authority (CA) Bundle

By default, `libcurl` uses the operating system's root certificate chain to authenticate peer certificate.

If you need to verify a self-signed certificate, you can use the `CaInfo` to specify the CA certificate bundle file, or `CaPath` to specify the directory where multiple CA certificate files are located. If `libcurl` is built against OpenSSL, the certificate directory must be prepared using the openssl `c_rehash` utility.

### Retrieving Certificate Information

After a successful request it is possible to retrieve certificate information. The return value is of type `std::vector<std::string>`. It contains one entry per certificate. An example can be found bellow:

```c++
Url url = "https://github.com";
Response response = cpr::Get(url);
std::vector<std::string> certInfo = response.GetCertInfo();
for (const std::string& s : certInfo)
{
    std::cout << "Info: " << s << '\n';
}
```

The output could look like:
```
[...]
Info: Subject:C = XX, L = Default City, O = Default Company Ltd
[...]
```
